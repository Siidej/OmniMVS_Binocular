# OmniMVS_Binocular
Based on paper "[OmniMVS: End-to-End Learning for Omnidirectional Stereo Matching](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Won_OmniMVS_End-to-End_Learning_for_Omnidirectional_Stereo_Matching_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)"  
Modified for binocular system like Intel REALSENSE T265  
Codes were heavily borrowed form [matsuren/omnimvs_pytorch](https://github.com/matsuren/omnimvs_pytorch)
